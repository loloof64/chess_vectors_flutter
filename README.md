# chess vectors flutter

Chess pieces vectors for Flutter.
These vectors are custom widgets based on Wikimedia commons Svg. You can customize the size.

## Getting Started

Add whatever piece widget you want to your components tree :
* size property takes a double value for defining the piece side size (same width and height),
* you can change the stroke and fill color for each piece (thanks to daniel-mf).

## CREDITS

This project is using the SVG definitions of Chess pieces from a [Wikimedia Commons page](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:SVG_chess_pieces)
